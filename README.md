Slowdown Bar
A browser extension that lets you control video playback speed by holding the spacebar.
Features

Set a Default Speed for normal video playback (0.25x - 4.0x)
Set a Spacebar Speed for when you hold the spacebar (0.25x - 4.0x)
Instantly switch between speeds with a simple spacebar hold
Works on most video streaming platforms

## How It Works

Video plays at Default Speed - Your videos play at your configured default speed
Hold spacebar → switches to Spacebar Speed - Instantly slow down or speed up
Release spacebar → returns to Default Speed - Immediately returns to normal playback
